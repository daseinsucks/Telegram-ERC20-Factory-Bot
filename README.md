# Telegram-ERC20-Factory-Bot

This is a relatively-simple telegram bot to collect data (name, symbol, total supply and type) about user's desired voting token, which then is passed to the website where user can approve the transaction using his Metamask wallet.

# Note:

Factory smart-contract is currently deployed on Goerli testnet, so you'll need Goerli test eth to operate it.
